## Sequence labeling evaluation
This Folder contains code that reproduces mGPT experiments for NER and POS.
- *sequence_labeling_prediction.ipynb* computes predictions for NER and POS tasks
- *sequence_labeling_evalution.ipynb* evaluates predictions created in *sequence_labeling_prediction.ipynb* and computes final scores.

### Data

`./data/UD_POS_data.tar.gz` contains data for POS evaluation on CIS & Low-Resource UD languages.

XGLUE data can be downloaded from [XGLUE Leaderboard](https://microsoft.github.io/XGLUE/). For this, you need to agree to the terms of service. After you do so, a download link will be made available.
