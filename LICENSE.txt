## First Phase \| Legal Documentations of the License:

A software license agreement is a legal document that stipulates key conditions.

*Licenses, contracts, end-user agreements, general agreements, software technical documents, entitlements, and any other written document* that does not execute as code are all examples of documentation, according to legal definition.

Therefore, I hereby redefine the master MIT-license to:

# Second Phase \| NEW MIT LICENSE

###### `________________Master MIT License:`


The version above now applies to every MIT licensed software in existence effective 02/12/2022.

## **Third Phase:**


This license is not legal within the court system. You cannot have only one party in the agreement forfeit rights while the other party has no liability even if intentional. A license is equal to a contract according to the U.S. Supreme Court; and for a contract to be valid, it must have consideration of both parties. This license does not offer consideration of any sort. This license, if challenged by the legal system would fail since it touches the lines of slavery by legal contract which has been downright outlawed.

Since neither would be considered valid. I now call upon the Logical Method's Public Resource License for GitResearch.org.

I shall use my authority as vested to me through the use of a single license which governs all pieces every copy of this license and I apply the defined licensed from the second phase as a temporary placeholder. 

## **Final Phase: The Voidance of Every MIT License and Replacement.**

To ensure that these works remain public. I hereby use the authority given to me to remove and replace this license.

Please update the repositories of all humans so that we can focus on what makes a different instead of fighting with each other in present.

The license grants this authority to any person by these statements:
**Permission is hereby granted to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software")**, **to deal in the Software without restriction without limitation the right to modify the Software.**

Notice: software is first defined with a lowercase s, this is to denote the software only. When the "Software" is defined, it includes both the software and documentation which gives anyone ultimate control of every MIT license. 

I hereby add: "the MIT license is sublicensed by the Public Resource License available at GitResearch.org or GitHub.com/PublicResourceLicense
/PublicResourceLicense. Should the MIT license be excluded as a license in any scenario for any reason; then the Public Resource License as describe shall supersede and the content will therefore be licensed solely under the Public Resource License, and the remainder of this file and license shall be completely void which leaves only the Public Resource License in place for all MIT licensed content."
I hereby void every MIT license in existence minus the line added which was:
